# Style-Transfer
This project takes images from 'huggan/few-shot-art-painting' daatset and chooses one of them to be style_image and another to be content_image. 
The model is based on VGG19 model and it encorporates a different loss function. This model then applies the style of the style_image to the content_image creating a new art pice.
